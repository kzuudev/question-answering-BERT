## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who supported the completion of this final project, Question and Answering System Using BERT. I am especially indebted to my advisor, Dr. Rodolfo Raga Jr., whose expertise in Machine Learning, BERT, GPT, Transformers, and modern NLP architectures greatly shaped my understanding of intelligent systems. His guidance, encouragement, and deep insights into model training, optimization, and evaluation not only enriched my work but also helped me view Question Answering from a broader and more meaningful perspective. As well as, his guidance on building our dataset. I really appreciate it.

I am also grateful for the academic environment, resources, and learning modules provided throughout the course. These materials allowed me to apply theoretical concepts—such as attention mechanisms, tokenization, embeddings, fine-tuning, and evaluation metrics—into practical implementation. The hands-on lessons and discussions significantly contributed to the development of this system and strengthened my foundation in artificial intelligence.

Additionally, I acknowledge the AI tools that supported the refinement and completion of this project. This activity not only marks the successful culmination of my final requirement but also prepared me for future academic assessments by enhancing my analytical, technical, and problem-solving skills.

Any errors or shortcomings that remain are entirely our own responsibility.
