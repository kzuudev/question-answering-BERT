        "This code establishes a sophisticated pipeline for preparing Question Answering (QnA) data. It initializes a BERT model for the QnA task and a SentenceTransformer model for semantic similarity. The script attempts to align abstract answers to the context using exact string matching first; if that fails, it employs semantic search to find the most similar sentence within the context. It then uses a sliding window tokenization strategy to handle long documents, aligns token positions, filters out invalid examples, and prepares the final datasets for training.\n",

The use of SentenceTransformer serves as a smart fallback mechanism, allowing the system to recover training labels even when the answer text doesn't exactly match the context string. Additionally, the sliding window mechanism ensures that long documents are split into manageable chunks without losing information at the boundaries, making the pipeline highly robust for real-world document parsing."

The UI allows users to select a study mode and a topic, generates questions with context, accepts user answers, and provides feedback based on semantic similarity to both a ground truth answer and the BERT model's extracted answer. It also manages session state to prevent repeating questions and allows users to reset their session.\n",
